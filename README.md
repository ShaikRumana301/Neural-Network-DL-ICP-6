The following steps are followed for ICP-6:

In Jupiter notepad written the code for the following and mentioned the comments for the code and uploaded the "ICP-6.ipynb" to repo:
 - First installed the packages Keras and Tensorflow.
 - Use Case Description: Predicting the diabetes disease
 - Programming elements: Keras Basics
 - In the programming:
      1.Used the use case in the class:
      2.Added more Dense layers to the existing code and check how the accuracy changes.  


In the "Neural Networks & DL ICP-6 Screenshots & Github link.pdf" file consists of screenshots of the resultant compiled code and Github link to the repository.

In the Video Link consists of Video regarding the technical explanation of the code.
